# MLCreditClassification
As our code is all in a .ipynb file, it can be run one cell at a time in Jupyter Notebook by simply selecting a cell, then clicking the apparent “Run” and “Run Selected Cell” button. It is important to mention that some of these cells, particularly the last one that generates our model’s accuracy scores, can take a while to fully complete. Additionally, be sure to import all the required libraries such as sklearn, xboost, and matplotlib before running the code, and be sure to change any directories so that some of the bigger visuals will be saved somewhere that suits your machine.
